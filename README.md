# SA.01: WK1: Code Challenge

#### Date: 29th September, 2024

## Description
    This repository contains solutions to three coding challenges:

1. **Papa's Grade Generator**:
    This  program prompts the user to input his/her student marks. It returns the correct grade based on the input.
     - Grade A: Marks > 79
     - Grade B: Marks 60 to 79
     - Grade C: Marks 50 to 59
     - Grade D: Marks 40 to 49
     - Grade E: Marks < 40

2. **Speed Detector**:
    This program takes the input speed of a car and returns the number of demerit points. The program prints "Ok" if the speed is below 70 km/h. 
    For every 5 km/h above the speed limit of 70 km/h, one demerit point is added. If the demerit points exceed 12, the program prints "License suspended".

3. **Net Salary Calculator**:
    This program calculates an individual's net salary by considering basic salary, benefits, and various deductions such as Payee (Tax), NHIF, and NSSF.
